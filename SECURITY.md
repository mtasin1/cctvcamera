# Advanced Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please follow our responsible disclosure process:

1. Report it to us via email at [mail](mailto:cctvcamerabdctg@gmail.com).
2. Avoid public disclosure until we have resolved the issue.https://github.com/mtasin1/cctvcamera/tree/main
3. Provide a clear and detailed explanation of the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce, affected versions, and potential impact.
4. Allow us a reasonable time to address the vulnerability before public disclosure.

## Bug Bounty Program

We appreciate the efforts of security researchers. We offer a bug bounty for responsibly disclosed security vulnerabilities. For more information and eligibility criteria, visit our [Bug Bounty Program page](https://example.com/bug-bounty).

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the current version and the last two stable releases.

## Reporting Process

1. Acknowledgment: We will acknowledge your report within 24 hours.
2. Investigation: We will investigate and validate the reported vulnerability.
3. Resolution: We will work on resolving the issue promptly.
4. Coordination: We will keep you informed of our progress and coordinate the release of fixes.
5. Public Disclosure: A public advisory will be released upon resolution.

## Disclosure Policy

- Full disclosure of vulnerabilities after resolution.
- Publicly credit individuals who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities.
- Follow the principles of coordinated disclosure.

## Coding Practices

- Conduct regular security training for developers.
- Implement threat modeling during the design phase.
- Enforce code review practices with a focus on security.
- Integrate automated security testing into the CI/CD pipeline.
- Perform penetration testing periodically.
- Follow the principle of least privilege for code and infrastructure.
- Implement runtime application self-protection (RASP) mechanisms.

## Continuous Monitoring and Response

- Use security information and event management (SIEM) tools for continuous monitoring.
- Implement incident response plans and conduct regular drills.
- Maintain a security incident response team (SIRT).
- Regularly review and update the security policy based on evolving threats.

## Secure Infrastructure

- Implement network segmentation to contain potential breaches.
- Use infrastructure-as-code (IaC) with security best practices.
- Regularly audit and review cloud provider configurations.
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
